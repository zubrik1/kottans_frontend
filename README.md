> 2. Networking for Web Developers:
- This course became my challenge. Now I know that if you want to set up and run Virtual Machine , you should make sure that
    your computer supports this actions. This hack was given to me by sleepless night, when I was trying to understand what wass wrong
    and why my VirtualBox didn't run. So, you shoud check up, if support for creating virtual machines is included. Where? in your Bios!
- Using Bios in this task.

> 3. Networking for Web Developers:
- This course gives me much new information. IP, TPI, DNS, NAT, IPv4, IPv6, etc.  It was a little hard to perceive this information
   in English. But all the lessons are good sructured and understandable on an intuitive level.
- It's cool now to understand how the Internet works.
- And I'm going to use this information...ðŸ˜ˆ
