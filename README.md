## Task 1

### Courses:

> __1. Linux Command Line Basics:__
- The amazing course to understand Linux Command Line Base for me (the person that did not know anything about this before).
- I was pleasantly surprised that Linux was so friendly and easy to use.

> __2. Networking for Web Developers:__
- This course became my challenge. Now I know that if you want to set up and run Virtual Machine, you should make sure that
   your computer supports this actions. This hack was given to me by sleepless night, when I was trying to understand what was wrong
   and why my VirtualBox didn't run. So, you shoud check up, if support for creating virtual machines is included. Where? in your Bios!
 - A thing, that surprised me was using Bios in this task.

> __3. Networking for Web Developers:__
- This course provided me with a lot of new information. IP, TPI, DNS, NAT, IPv4, IPv6, etc.  It was a little hard to perceive this information in English. But all the lessons are good sructured and understandable on an intuitive level.
- It's cool now to understand how the Internet works.
- And I'm going to use this information...ðŸ˜ˆ

## Task 6

### Courses: Object Oriented JS
- I think it is fundamental course. Funda(wait-wait-wait)mental.
- Really! It was new and very informative. Some topic I needed to watch few times and some of them I had to learn with a little help of our resources (A great book [Ð¡Ð¾Ð²Ñ€ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹ ÑƒÑ‡ÐµÐ±Ð½Ð¸Ðº Javascript](https://learn.javascript.ru/) helped me.)
- Things that shook my mind: JavaScriptâ€™s variable scoping, closures, "this", protype delegation, decorator pattern,pseudoclasses and subclasses.
- I liked the Object Oriented Conception. It really good represents real world. But also I know JS includes functional paradigm.
